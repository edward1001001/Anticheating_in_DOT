# Instance Generating Code
The python codes to generate 500 DOT instances, and each instance includes a colluding probability matrix ``P`` following the ``Dirichlet distribution``, and the competences of students ``Y`` which are ``i.i.d. uniformly at random from [0.25, 1)``.
See the Section 3 in the supplymentary information of the [science of learning paper]() for more details.

The ``instance_helper.py`` is from the folder ``MMM and ILP in python``.

The settings for the number of students ``N``, the size of the problem pool ``M2``, and the number of questions in one test ``M1`` can be changed in the ``config.py`` file.
