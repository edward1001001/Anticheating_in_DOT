# Optimization-based Anti-collusion Algorithms for Distanced Online Testing (DOT)
This repository contains the code and simulation data for our anti-cheating algorithms described in the following papers:
### [Optimized Collusion Prevention for Online Exams during Social Distancing]
### [Anti-cheating Online Exams by Minimizing the Cheating Gain](https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202005.0502.v1). Preprints, 2020.

## Prerequisites
The codes are developed in two platforms. The Grouping-based Anti-collusion Scheme (GAS) and Cyclic Greedy Searching (CGS) algorithms are developed in MATLAB R2018a. 
The Min-Max Greedy Matching (MMM) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) algorithms are developed in Python v3.6, and the dependent packages include:
* networkx v2.1
* numpy v1.14.3
* scipy v1.1.0
* pulp v1.6.8
* matplotlib v2.2.2
